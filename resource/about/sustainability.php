                    <p>At Clean Sheen, we take our environmental responsibility seriously and have implemented a number of changes not only in our services but also in our office practices across Gujarat. We now have a comprehensive sustainability policy and action plan of how to reduce our impact on the environment both as a company and also as individuals. As a Surat-based cleaning company, we believe in keeping not just your premises clean but also our planet.</p>

            <p>Our team is passionate about protecting our planet and we even sent our office manager to a special training to educate us how to do this more efficiently. We have implemented our policy in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to help support the global movement of environmental and social responsibility. As a Gujarat-based company, we aim to set an example for sustainable housekeeping practices in Surat and beyond.</p>

                        <p>We try to reduce printing and paper use by printing as little as possible. We have reduced our use of batteries, especially those with high level of lead, mercury and cadmium. We segregate waste properly and only use plastics in the office with reusable options. In Surat, we ensure proper waste disposal at all our client locations across Gujarat.</p>

                        <p>We are actively trying to minimise the waste of electric energy and water. We are switching off lights when they are not needed and turning off our computers instead of putting them on standby. We also take our social responsibility by ordering just as much drinking water as we need and washing our glasses by hand. In the majority of cases our cleaners and staff use public transport to get to work, reducing our carbon footprint across Gujarat.</p>

                        <p>We give preference to suppliers with clear social responsibility and environmental statements and we purchase everything in bulk to save on packaging and unnecessary transport. We use refillable bottles and containers for our cleaning materials where possible and our electric equipment is frequently serviced to reduce replacements. We try to use as much recycled paper as possible and we always encourage customers to do the same.</p>

                    <p>The SDGs are integral to our philosophy as a company with enhanced corporate social responsibility so we decided to deepen that and implement new policies for our cleaners and admin staff. Now we can demonstrate a track record of environmentally conscious decisions, from offering eco-friendly cleaning options to reducing plastic use in our office.</p>
