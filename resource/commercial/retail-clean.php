                <p>
                    Retail cleaning is essential but easy to overlook when you are busy running your store.
                    Dusty shelves, smudged glass and dirty floors can quickly damage the way customers see
                    your brand.

                    quieter times.

                <h3>What Our Retail Cleaning Covers</h3>
                <p>
                    Retail cleaning is important for keeping your shop or showroom both clean and safe. Even a small
                    amount of dust or dirt can make floors slippery and put off customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our retail cleaning services cover all essential areas of a store. Typically this includes:

                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>Cleaning staff kitchen and break areas</li>
                    <li>Cleaning public and staff washrooms</li>
                    <li>Hoovering, mopping and other floor cleaning</li>
                    <li>Dusting and high‑level cobweb removal</li>
                    <li>Cleaning and sanitising store furniture</li>
                    <li>Keeping storage areas tidy</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">
                    We tailor the checklist to your site so you only pay for what you need, with the right number of
                    cleaners to get the job done efficiently.

                <h3>Legal Requirements for Retailers</h3>
                <p>
                    Retail environments must meet basic health and safety standards. Our cleaning routines help you
                    comply with your obligations so staff and customers stay safe.
                </p>
                <h4>Health &amp; Safety</h4>
                <p>
                    Clean, dry floors and hygienic washrooms reduce slips, trips and illness. Regular cleaning also
                    supports risk assessments and safety checks.
                </p>
                <h4>Food Safety</h4>
                <p>
                    For stores that handle food, we follow guidance from local regulations for safe storage, handling
                    and cleaning of food areas. If you have specific product requirements, we can work with your
                    preferred suppliers.

                Our process is straightforward. First, we discuss your store layout, opening hours and priorities.
                Then we visit if needed to estimate how many cleaners are required and how often.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on this, we send a customised proposal that fits your needs and budget, so you know exactly
                what to expect before we start.
